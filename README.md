# Azure SignalR + API Management POC

This repository is a POC exploring how Azure SignalR works behind Azure API Management (APIM), with authentication/authorization via Keycloak. 
It includes IaC with OpenTofu, a .NET 9 Hub API hosted on Azure Container Apps, a .NET 9 console client, 
and a React web client hosted on Azure Static Web Apps (SWA).
